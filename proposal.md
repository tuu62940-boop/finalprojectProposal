# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Super Breakout, Luke and Jai's funtime game of games (name is work in progress

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project is going to be a Breakout clone but with a twist instead of only being able to move left to right our game will allow the user to move up and down as well.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our final project will be a creative twist on the classic Breakout game. Just like the original, the player will control a paddle to bounce a ball and break blocks, but instead of only moving left and right, the paddle can also move up and down. This extra movement adds a new layer of strategy and difficulty to the game, as players will need to position themselves in both axes to keep the ball in play. The game will include features such as score tracking and possibly power-ups like larger paddles or multiple balls. It will be executed using Python with a application like Pygame. This twist makes the classic gameplay more dynamic and engaging while still keeping the core mechanics familiar.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Partner Name: Saketh (Jai) Nayak, Email Address: tuu52393@temple.edu, TA: Negar Koushki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for thi

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I can accomplish making a simple to play game that is easy to pick up and runs smoothly if I can manage to make a game like that I will be happy

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final is a smooth running game that is enjoyable for any and everyone to play and would be a game that someone would play for fun and would play to past some time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps will be to learn how to use Pygame to build the structure of the game. Learning how to set up the basics of the game in order for it to be playable. We will need to research how to detect collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks, and how to make the paddle move in both directions—left and right as well as up and down. We will also need to learn how to keep track of the score, add levels or difficulty increases, and possibly include extra features like power-ups or multiple balls. To stay organized, Jai will focus on designing the paddle and ball movement mechanics , While I will work on the bones of the game and the overall structure. Together, we will test the game, debug any issues, and make sure it runs smoothly before final submission. This project will require us to strengthen our understanding of Python, Pygame, loops, and game physics.
